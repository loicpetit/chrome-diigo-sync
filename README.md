# chrome-diigo-sync

That project is to synchronize Chrome bookmarks with Diigo bookmarks automatically. The use of a Chrome extension is required to have access to the Chrome's bookmarks. Diigo has an open API to get an set bookmarks. For instance that API miss some functionnality (delete bookmarks, tags for example), so the extension is not fully functionnal as it could be.
